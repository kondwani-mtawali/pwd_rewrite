1. Command Implement
The coreutil I rewrote was pwd. The script supports its two flags: -L(logical path) and -P(physical path). The default
behavoir if no flags are provided is logical. I also put in a help display that gives the user instructions.

2. I encountered numerous issues when writing this script:
- I attempted to use basename and dirname initially to handle symlinks to replicate the function of -P but it ultimately failed. I discovered
readlink was a simple command that retrieved the path that a symbolic link was pointing to.
- Figuring out how to ensure that my function was pointing to the current working directory was a bit of a challenge as well. I decided to write
a function that validates the directory by storing the directory and then attempting to cd into it.
- Figuring out how to actually obtain the path wasn't simple. I eventually discovered that I could essentially work backwards in the file hierarchy 
and build the path that way.

3. No part of this was particularly easy. Providing the flag options was probably the easiest part as case statements and getopts are useful tools
for providing user options.
